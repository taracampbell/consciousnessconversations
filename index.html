						<p>Conversations on Consciousness, is a student-organized interdisciplinary conference that aims to encourage a dialogue between experts in diverse fields with an interest in conscious experience. This October 20th, 2014 will be our inaugural year and we will address two themes: 1) How should our knowledge about consciousness guide our treatment of animals? and 2) What can the investigation of subjective experience, i.e., meditation, teach us about consciousness? Our speakers will include cognitive scientist and vegan activist Stevan Harnad, religious studies scholar and vegan activist Marion Achoulias, Philip Buckley, a phenomenologist and Ajahn Brahm, an ex-theoretical physicist and Buddhist monk.</p>

						<p>In the spirit of conversation, each theme will first be addressed by two speakers, drawing from the perspectives of their discipline, before a conversation involving all speakers and members of the audience will be encouraged. Between sessions, Ajahn Brahm will provide meditation instruction and lead a sitting. All conference attendees are invited to experience, first-hand, the practice of meditation before enjoying a vegan lunch. Registration is $5.00 in person and $6.29 online.</p>

						<p>Ajahn Brahm will also be giving a <a href="womenandgender.html">talk</a> at 5:00 PM on women and gender equality in Therāvada Buddhism that everyone is welcome to attend.</p>

		    		<p>Marion is a scholar of Religion at University of Concordia with a commitment to the interdisciplinary field of Critical Animal Studies. Her interests are secular and religious animal ethics, as well as animal liberation as a form of cultural critique. She is a vegan activist with KARA (Kebek Animal Rights Association) and has organized the International March to Close Down all Slaughterhouses.</p>

		    		<h1>Ajahn Brahm</h1>
		    		<p>Ajahn Brahm renounced the hallowed halls of Cambridge University where he studied theoretical physics to travel to Thailand and ordain as a Buddhist monk. His book “Mindfulness, Bliss and Beyond”, serves as a guidebook to those interested in rigorously pursuing the practice of meditation in order to glean insights about the nature of the mind. His years of meditation practice make him a unique authority on the possibilities of principled introspection, in the Buddhist tradition, as a tool for understanding the mind.</p>

		    		<h1>Philip Buckley</h1>
		    		<p>Professor Buckley is the Chair of the Department of East Asian Studies at McGill, formerly acting as Chair of the Department of Philosophy. His research focusses on the phenomenology of Husserl, whose project it was to start with first-person experience and discover structures therein that allow for rational cognition. He was also the coordinator of a research team exploring "Phenomenology and Ethics." His recent work has given him an opportunity to investigate the ways in which culture shapes experience.</p>

		    		<h1>Stevan Harnad</h1>
		    		<p>Stevan Harnad is the Canada Research Chair in Cognitive Science. He is a strong proponent of the notion that building machines that are indistinguishable in function from humans (“Turing Testing”), is the only empirical method available for understanding the function of the human mind. Our interest in starting a conversation between experts in various disciplines investigating the mind was inspired by the journal founded by Steven Harnad, Behavioral and Brain Sciences (BBS). BBS provides a forum for dialogue between eminent scientists on controversial and novel ideas in the sciences of mind. Stevan Harnad is a passionate vegan activist and is as certain as one can possibly be that animals are conscious (i.e., they feel).</p>
